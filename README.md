# Alien-Runner-2D

Game made with the help Of Unity Engine and C# language.

Explores basic player movements,camera following scripts,starting window,
End Credit screens,points collection,trigger systems pause menu and restart 
with a menu screen with music and various interactive audio systems.
Theres a lot of newer playing physics in this project compared to 
my last project.This project has a endless system so you can play 
for as long as you want unless you die or restart yourself.

Theres also various triggers system and object pooling is done so 
that project doesn't have too much data one point.
